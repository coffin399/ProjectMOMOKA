Project MOMOKA - NOTICE

2025-11-05
- Removed legacy local diffusers pipeline directory `MOMOKA/generator/imagen/` and associated tooling. Forge API now handles all image generation.
- Pruned diffusers-only dependencies (`torch`, `accelerate`, `safetensors`, `diffusers`) from `requirements.txt` to eliminate unused installs.
- Deleted Stable Diffusion Forge UI assets under `lib/stable-diffusion-webui-forge/javascript/` which were only required for the Gradio WebUI and not for API operation.
- Consolidated `requirements.txt` for Python 3.10, pinning core bot, Forge API, and Style-Bert-VITS2 dependencies (including submodule needs) for reproducible installs.
- Updated Pillow to 10.4.0 in both project and Forge requirements to avoid source builds failing under Python 3.10 on Windows.
- Bumped `safetensors` to 0.5.2 across project and Forge manifests to use prebuilt wheels and eliminate Rust toolchain requirements.
- Guarded `scikit-image==0.21.0` to only install on Python < 3.13 so newer interpreters skip building from source.
- Updated `startMOMOKA.bat` to require the `py -3.10` launcher, ensuring the virtual environment is always created with Python 3.10.x.
- Pinned `pyopenjtalk-dict==1.0.1` for Python 3.10 compatibility since newer releases require Python 3.11+.
